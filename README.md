# Chess
A small JAVA project to showcase OOP in JAVA Class: CS 3354.R01 Dr. Xiaomin Li Team members: Miguel Alvarez pqg5

Current Status: At current status only able to display board properly with spots and pieces displaying current name No functions in place to take input from users or move pieces correctly.

Second attempt at creating repo due to wanting to add testing via JUNIT testing. Faced problems with orginal post and with not a lot of progress made, decided to reset project.

Plans: Plan to set up each piece to check which moves can be made, moves to be added to white/black player move set to be used to find if King is in check.
